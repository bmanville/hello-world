# hello-world
my first github project
I have worked in IT since 1978.  Hard to believe that a woman could be in technology that long ago.
I am a Kripalu certified yoga instructor and practice meditation and mindfulness regularly.  
I'm working on reinventing myself and so I thought I would start with this opensource project.
